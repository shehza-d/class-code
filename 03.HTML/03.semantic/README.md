[AI-POWERED Read aloud feature of Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/features/read-aloud)

Semantic markup refers to marking up a document with extra information about the actual data structure behind the information, rather than styling the document with exclusively visual information

Understanding and utilizing semantic markup helps ensure that valuable content reaches your target audience. Search engines weigh keyword importance by their placement in the HTML hierarchy. For example, keywords enclosed in an `<h1>` tag are given more importance than those enclosed in an `<p>`.

**Semantic markup is mostly used for Screen readers, Crawler and for SEO.**

## Screen readers

Screen readers are software programs that allow blind or visually impaired users to read the text that is displayed on the computer screen with a speech synthesizer or braille display. A screen reader is the interface between the computer's operating system, its applications, and the user.

## Crawler

A crawler is a program used by search engines to collect data from the internet. When a crawler visits a website, it picks over the entire website's content (i.e. the text) and stores it in a databank. It also stores all the external and internal links to the website.
