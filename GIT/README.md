# Git and Github

1. Install Git from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
1. If everything went well, it should return the Git version that is installed on your computer.
1. If you don't have already Sign up for an account at [github.com](https://github.com/signup).
1. Once inside, you'll find your own Repositories.
1. Create a new project on github.com simply by clicking the `New` button and giving it a unique name.
1. Keep your repos public.
1. Copy http link below green code button

```bash
git clone <link>
```

1. This command will generate a hidden `.git` folder in your project, where Git stores all internal tracking data for the current repository. We don't need to look and change in .git.

1. and then add files in your project.

```bash
git add .
```

```bash
git commit -m "my message"
```

```bash
git push
```

1. Add your digital creations to the repository – your code, documents, images, or anything you create!

## Important

1. Repository is just a folder in Git.
1. Always make a repo before starting to code.
1. Keep committing code after finishing ever feature.
1. Keep you commit messages relevant to your feature.
