[What is DNS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/)

## DNS

The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com.

## IP address

A unique string of characters that identifies each computer using the Internet Protocol to communicate over a network.

Example:

![Example of IP address](./ip.png)

## Domain

When referring to an Internet address or name, a domain or domain name is the location of a website.

For example, the domain name "google.com" points to the IP address "216.58.216.164". Generally, it's easier to remember a name rather than a long string of numbers
